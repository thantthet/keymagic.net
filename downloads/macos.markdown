### [Download macOS Installler](https://github.com/thantthet/keymagic/releases/tag/macos-1.5.6)

- Installation could be failed when you install only for current user and previous version was installed for all users. To fix this either
  1. Install for all users or
  2. Delete manually `/Library/Input Methods/KeyMagic.app` and try to install again.
